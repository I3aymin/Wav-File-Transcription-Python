# Wav-File-Transcription-Python
The program hosts a local flask server to take in a wav file to be transcribed using the google translate API.

The program does need the Flask, Python3, and Google Translate API libraries implemented or downloaded to operate. The program uses flask to host a local webpage to upload the WAV file. The WAV file is transribed and the webpage is updated to show the transcript.
